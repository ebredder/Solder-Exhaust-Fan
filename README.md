# Solder Exhaust Fan

![Solder Exhaust Fan][pic1]

This project was collaboratively developed by the Fall 2017 AC/DC Fundamentals class. Principles in this project provided an application of Ohm's Law and calculating voltage and current on a standard computer fan using a digital multimeter. The project introduced soldering, circuit design/schematic drawing, component selection, electronic product design, and iteration. This project became a regular tool in the lab used by these students and more to work on projects and safely solder in the lab space.
